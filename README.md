# RNA-m5C-HSPC-Expansion
We characterize the mRNA m5C landscape of nascent, fetal and adult HSPCs in zebrafish and found that m5C modification is essential for HSPC expansion through maintaining mRNA stability. Deletion of the m5C reader, Y-box binding protein 1 (Ybx1), significantly inhibits the proliferation of HSPCs.
